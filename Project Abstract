# My-BDG2-Project
This study presents a robust data-driven framework for forecasting energy consumption across multiple building sites using deep learning, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Leveraging the publicly available BDG2 dataset, which integrates hourly electricity consumption, meteorological conditions, and building metadata. We formulate the problem as a multivariate time series regression task. The methodology involves extensive preprocessing, including data cleaning, feature engineering (such as lag features and rolling statistics), and merging building-level consumption with site-specific weather data. LSTM is selected as the final forecasting model due to its superior performance in capturing temporal dependencies, outperforming traditional ensemble models such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM in RMSE and MAE across all top five buildings.
To enhance the reliability of the forecasting system, anomaly detection is incorporated using both Isolation Forest and Autoencoder methods. Results show that Isolation Forest detects anomalies with an average rate of 15%, while Autoencoders yield about 20%, indicating the modelâ€™s sensitivity to fluctuations in energy patterns. The implementation concludes with an interactive dashboard created using Plotly, which enables visualization of actual vs predicted usage, overlays and key weather variables. This dashboard was explored directly within the Colab environment, supporting seamless data inspection and validation. The integrated framework demonstrates the viability of combining deep learning with anomaly detection and visualization to address challenges in multi-site energy forecasting.
