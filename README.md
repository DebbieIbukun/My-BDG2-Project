# My-BDG2-Project
This study presents a robust data-driven framework for forecasting energy consumption across multiple building sites using deep learning, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Leveraging the publicly available BDG2 dataset, which integrates hourly electricity consumption, meteorological conditions, and building metadata.
